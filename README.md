# security
Demonstration on how to develop more secure Python applications. By showing the most common vulnerabilities in Python apps and how to set up a coding environment that helps you develop code with security in mind. Here I address how to avoid common pitfalls associated with loose typing and assertions and find out how to deserialize Pickle data. Then I explore the security features—such as code generation and secrets management—in Django, a popular Python framework. I also demo how to secure a RESTful API in Django using permissions, data serialization, and automated testing, and lastly I add some tips for securing applications written with Flask, a powerful micro web framework.
